# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Tailwind gradient classes
bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 to-purple-100 dark:from-gray-900 dark:to-blue-900
What this does:
bg-gradient-to-br = gradient going "to bottom right"
from-blue-50 = starts with very light blue
to-purple-100 = ends with light purple
dark:from-gray-900 = in dark mode, starts with dark gray
dark:to-blue-900 = in dark mode, ends with dark blue
